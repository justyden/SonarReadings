# Acura Project Status Report Week 1

### Tyler Thompson
- Continued research on papers concerning the training of neural networks.
- Collected information on processes and techniques previous researchers have done, to smooth out the data they were using.
- Collected more websites containing images of side scan sonar. Noted that most of them do not contain objects, but rather the sea floor instead.
- Began to think about how data could be synthesized in case the open source data is not enough for this project. The main research project that this project is based off of has done this. In this case, more research will need to be conducted to see how it is done.
