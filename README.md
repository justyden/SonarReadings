# The Project
In this Acura project multiple Penn State students are tasked with using a BlueROV2 robot from [Blue Robotics](https://bluerobotics.com/). This robot was constructed with side scan sonar to be able to reterive sonar readings of bodies of water. Using these sonar images, a deep learning neural work will be trained to indentify objects within these sonar readings. This project is directed by Professor Avanzato at Penn State University.
